The build has been migrated to Gradle.

To build:

  ./gradlew build      (Linux, MacOS etc.)
  gradlew.bat build    (Windows)

(For the rest of these instructions only ./gradlew will be referenced. 
Substitute as appropriate for Windows).

To install to local Maven Repo:

  ./gradlew install

To upload SNAPSHOT to OSS.JFrog (Requires Bintray credentials)

  ./gradlew artifactoryUpload

To upload release version to Bintray (Requires Bintray credentials)

  ./gradlew uploadArchives

To set up Bintray credentials edit ~/.gradle/gradle.properties and add
 
  bintrayUserName=YOUR_USERNAME
  bintrayApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY

(Don't leave spaces at the end of the line, otherwise you'll spend hours trying
to figure out why nothing works).

Alternatively pass the value as preopties on the command-line:

  ./gradlew uploadArchives -PbintrayUserName=YOUR_USERNAME -PbintrayApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY

If you don't have valid Bintray credentials you can still build and run tests, just set up
the above two properties with dummy values


To create appropriate project files for Eclipse and IntelliJ just do

   ./gradlew eclipse

OR

  ./gradlew idea
